# Animate Virtual Keyboard

This mini-project is a practice project to test Events in JavaScript and animations in CSS.
It works in such a way that when the project is loaded, everything you type on your keyboard is printed in the bar above the keyboard, and you can even delete those texts and replace them with other texts.
